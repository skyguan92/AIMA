## [v0.2.0] - 2026-03-25 — "Connect the Dots"

36 commits, 108 files changed, 22468 insertions, 1047 deletions since v0.0.1.

### Added

- **Support Service Integration** — `internal/support/` standalone component with self-register, polling, task lifecycle, prompt/notify callbacks, and recovery code flow
- **askforhelp CLI** — interactive terminal UX with invite/worker/recovery code prompts, budget display (USD + task count), referral codes, and foreground wait mode
- **askforhelp MCP tool** — `support.askforhelp` wired via `ToolDeps.SupportAskForHelp`
- **Web UI redesign** — Apple-aesthetic embedded SPA with light/dark mode toggle
- **OpenClaw provider plugin** — LLM/ASR/TTS/image_gen backend integration with reverse proxy discovery
- **Embedded AIMA skills** — multimodal agent tool definitions for OpenClaw
- **Deployment scenarios** — `catalog/scenarios/` asset kind for multi-model deployment recipes (e.g. `openclaw-multi`)
- **Blackwell CUDA TTS engine** — GPU-accelerated TTS for GB10/Blackwell
- **Z-Image model + diffusers engine** — text-to-image support via diffusers backend
- **qwen3.5-9b model asset** — 9B dense model with native multimodal support
- **Hardware ID candidates** — robust device dedup using board serial, product serial, IOPlatformSerialNumber, MAC address
- **In-memory message log** — fixes lost notifications in UI polling

### Changed

- **Support endpoint** — migrated from `http://121.37.119.185/platform` to `https://aimaserver.com/platform`
- **Support wire format** — aligned with latest server API: budget USD fields, bound status, referral count, display language, hardware_id_candidates
- **Support wiring simplified** — 13-line closure in main.go replaced by single `supportSvc.AskForHelpJSON` call
- **Model path resolution** — fixed mismatch between root systemd service and regular user paths

### Fixed

- TTS format mismatch and image understanding config in OpenClaw
- Missing `http://` scheme in backend addresses for reverse proxy
- Agent pipeline: 4 bugs found during live GLM-4.7-Flash validation
- Orphaned explore runs and null-slice JSON responses
- Data races in proxy server and native runtime
- 4 data-integrity issues in knowledge sync/import/export and hardware identity
- Exact engine `metadata.name` preference when resolving variants

### Infrastructure

- 94 MCP tools (Knowledge 23, Agent 9, Deploy 8, Engine 7, Model 6, Tuning 4, Fleet 4, Explore 4, Benchmark 4, Stack 3, Scenario 3, OpenClaw 3, Catalog 3, App 3, System 2, Hardware 2, Device 2, Support 1, Shell 1, Download 1, Discover 1)
- 3 runtimes: K3S, Docker, Native
- 9 hardware profiles, 25 engine YAMLs, 19 model YAMLs, 3 deployment scenarios
- Supported platforms: darwin-arm64, linux-arm64, linux-amd64, windows-amd64
